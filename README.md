# Mini-MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
A handwritten digit classification for 0, 1, 4 and 5.

Three models were used: Simple Perceptron, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression. The goal is to separate the digits 0, 1, 4, and 5, plot graphs, and measure accuracy and confusion matrix.

The data were previously reduced to intensity and symmetry.
